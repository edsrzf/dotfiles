The Bazaar hacking guide (HACKING in the source tarball) should be applicable 
to bzr-gtk as well, with a few exceptions listed in this file.

bzr-gtk is a set of GTK+ frontends to Bazaar. Integration between components 
and with the system is highly welcome. 

The GNOME Human Interface Guidelines 
(http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/) should be followed where 
possible.

Several parts of bzr-gtk are currently using glade. However, we are slowly
trying to move away from glade so please don't add new code that uses glade and
try to remove the use of glade.

Please update the NEWS file when closing bugs or adding new features.
